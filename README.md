# 🪙 Simple Decentralized Exchange (DEX)

A lightweight Node.js-based simulation of a decentralized exchange that allows users to "sell" ETH and receive an equivalent amount of USDC based on the constant product formula (x * y = k).

## 🚀 Features

- Simulates ETH to USDC trading using an automated market maker (AMM) model.
- Uses the constant product formula to determine price impact.
- Simple API endpoint for selling ETH.
